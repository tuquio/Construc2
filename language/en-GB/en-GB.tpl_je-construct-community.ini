			<p>Now that you've installed Construct, getting started is easy. The 40 included module positions occupy the most commonly used areas within a template. With dynamic width logic, the availability of two left and two right columns, the numerous module positions and expanded functionality via template parameters, building your unique Joomla website is greatly simplified with this framework. Once you have your content, components and modules in place, just add your unique style.</p>
			<p>Adding your unique style is accomplished by adding a custom style sheet to the CSS directory located within Construct. Once created, just open Construct in the Template Manager and select YES next to <em>Use custom style sheet</em> and select the one you added. There is also an example template pack included within this template&rsquo;s installation archive to help you get you started; just extract the example template pack archive to this template&rsquo;s directory.</p>
			<p>Construct Pro's integrated mobile device detection ensures that all of your visitors get the content they desire. The included mobile version of the template is a great start for serving your mobile audience. It&rsquo;s fast loading and easy to use design fita most devices well.</p>
			<p>Allowing even greater flexablity of your design is Construct Pro's ability to add article, menu item, category, section and component specific extended template overrides. Place these appropriately named files in the right folder and the template will load them automatically. For example, to create an extended template override for article 37, add your new layout named <code>article-37.php</code> to <em>/layouts/article</em> and CSS named <code>article-37.css</code> to <em>/css/article</em>.</p>
