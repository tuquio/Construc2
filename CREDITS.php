"Construc2" (codename) is a HTML5 Template for Joomla 1.7/2.5 and carries several
ideas inspired by "Construct Comunity Template Framework for Joomla! 1.6".
It has since been heavily refactored after being forked on gihub.com on June 20th, 2011.
See README.md for the many initial changes.

"Construc2" includes the OOCSS Framework by Nicole 'stubornella' Sullivan,
being the most lightweight, yet flexible and "done right" CSS library around
(the other "done right" framework would be YAML, but it's too heavy lifting for
my taste.)
All overrides incl. module Chromes have been adopted to utilize OOCSS to reduce
the amount of styles needed.
Component overrides are based off Beez5.

Special thanks to marineart.de and branz-consulting.de for allowing the use of
several layout and styling techniques "to challenge" their needs for J!1.5 back
in 2007/2008, and built into their websites: (in no particular order)
 - include static HTML "snippet files" Module
 - alternative Homepage layout override
 - dynamic menu item alias as a more powerful replacement for "pageclass_sfx"
 - dynamic category als alias-based based CSS
 - parametrised Module Chrome based on attributes
 - content plugin events in Module output
 - extended and semantic "mainmenu"
 - CSS packer based on CSSTidy

This template and its originating framework would not exists without the inspiration
and ingenuity of countless individuals and other projects.
Following is a inconclusive list of those individuals, projects and other resources
that helped to shape it.
If you feel that you should be included in this list, we offer you our sincerest
apologies for omitting you and ask that you contact us at joomla@webmechanic.biz
